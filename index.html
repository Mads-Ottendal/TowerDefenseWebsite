        <h1>THE GAME</h1>
        <p>This game is a classic Tower Defense game, with the main objective being killing the waves of enemies trying to get the end of the map.
         There are various enemies (just 3 for now) which are all rats. Each rat has its own attributes such as their speed, health and the amount of money they drop after being killed.</p>

        <p class="paragraphspace">You can create you own map and play it</p>
